# HW1_RefactoringHTML
Homework 1 refactoring an HTML

This project was an edit of an existing HTML in order to make the code more accesible. This was done by re-formatting the code to be more readable by screen-readers. 

This was done by changing <div> elements to more specific elements such as <nav> and <ul>. Also, by re-oredering some lines to reflect the importance of the content by moving the most important to the top of the page.

It is possible that by copying and pasting the original HTML into my visual studio code, some automatic reformatting happened. Some changes were made that I did not remember implementing.
